### Database Schema Design

The application is built on a structured database schema hosted on Microsoft Azure, with three primary management areas:

- **Patient Management**: Enables patients to register, log in, and schedule vaccine appointments.
- **Caregiver Management**: Supports caregivers (hospital staff) in logging in and administering appointments.
- **Vaccine Inventory Management**: Tracks the availability and reservation status of vaccine doses to ensure accurate and timely administration.

### Appointment Scheduling

Patients can schedule or cancel vaccine appointments based on caregiver availability and the current vaccine inventory. This streamlined scheduling process helps clinics ensure efficient vaccine administration and resource management.
